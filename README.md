# Sentinel — Operational Awareness Console

A full-stack command-and-control (C2) dashboard for field asset monitoring, correlated incident triage, and AI-assisted operator decision support.

The architecture mirrors the operator-facing layer of platforms like PRISM and MOSAIC: field assets report telemetry, events are correlated into incidents, and operators get a unified picture of site health across personnel, vehicles, and sensors — without toggling between tools.

## Live demo

| Surface | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | [`https://sentinel-ops-flame.vercel.app`](https://sentinel-ops-flame.vercel.app) |
| API | [`https://sentinel-ops-api.fly.dev`](https://sentinel-ops-api.fly.dev) |
| API docs | [`https://sentinel-ops-api.fly.dev/docs`](https://sentinel-ops-api.fly.dev/docs) |

> The API runs on a Fly.io machine that auto-stops when idle. The first request after a quiet period may take ~5–10 s to wake the machine and complete; subsequent requests are immediate.

The demo accounts in the table below work against the live deployment too.

## Quick start (local, SQLite, no Docker)

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, Node 20+

```bash
# 1. Generate a JWT secret
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 2. Backend
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# → API at http://localhost:8000
# → Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs

# 3. Frontend (new terminal)
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
# → UI at http://localhost:5173
```

The backend seeds the database on first startup — demo accounts, a site, 5 assets, 5 events, and one correlated incident are created automatically. The simulator then continues adding live events and correlated incidents while the API is running.

---

## Docker (PostgreSQL)

```bash
# Copy and fill in required variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<output of: openssl rand -hex 32>
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key, or leave empty to use the deterministic fallback>

docker compose up --build
```

- API: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`

## Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@sentinel.dev` | `sentinel123` | Full read/write |
| Operator | `operator@sentinel.dev` | `sentinel123` | Incident transitions, event export |
| Viewer | `viewer@sentinel.dev` | `sentinel123` | Read-only, no status mutations |

## Walkthrough

The following 8-step walkthrough covers every system capability in under 5 minutes, framed around a realistic operational scenario: *a perimeter sensor fires at 03:00, the system correlates it with a geofence breach, and an operator triages from the console.*

1. **Login as operator** (`operator@sentinel.dev` / `sentinel123`)
   JWT issued, role-aware nav rendered, WebSocket connects — green "LIVE" indicator appears in the header.

2. **Dashboard**
   Metric cards show active incidents, assets in alert, and system health (all computed live from DB).
   The 24-hour activity histogram shows event volume by hour; the event feed updates every 8 s from the simulator.

3. **Site → Live Asset Map**
   Leaflet map with CartoDB Dark Matter tiles. Markers are colored by asset status (green/amber/red/grey).
   Pulse rings appear at event coordinates for 6 s when the simulator fires — demonstrating the map is wired to the same WebSocket feed as the toast notifications.

4. **Assets**
   Filter by `alert` status. Click the flagged asset: inspect the detail panel — zone, battery level, recent event timeline, related incidents.

5. **Incidents**
   Select a correlated incident. Click **Generate Summary** — the AI produces structured triage output: likely cause, affected assets, suggested next checks.
   A second click returns instantly with a **"cached"** badge (served from DB, no OpenAI call).
   Click **Refresh** to force regeneration and watch the badge flip to **"live"**.

6. **Acknowledge**
   Click **Acknowledge**. Status transitions from `open → acknowledged`. The AI cache clears automatically because the status is part of the prompt — the next summary will reflect the updated state.

7. **Events → Export CSV**
   Apply a `critical` severity filter. Click **Export CSV** — downloads a properly-headed CSV of the filtered audit trail with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

8. **Login as viewer** (`viewer@sentinel.dev` / `sentinel123`)
   Confirm status action buttons are hidden. A direct `PATCH /api/incidents/{id}/status` returns `403 Forbidden`.

| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` | API log verbosity for request, realtime, and AI fallback logs |
| `SIMULATOR_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Toggle the background event generator |
| `SIMULATOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | No | `8` | Seconds between generated events |

---

## Running the test suite

```bash
# Backend — pytest, 75 tests, ~5 s
cd apps/api
pytest -v

# Frontend — Vitest + React Testing Library, 18 tests, ~1 s
cd apps/web
npm test
```

The local backend suite uses an isolated file-based SQLite database — no running server or Postgres instance required. CI runs the backend suite against PostgreSQL and the frontend suite against jsdom. Frontend coverage focuses on:

- `lib/tones.ts` — pinning severity/status → colour mappings against silent renames.
- `lib/date.ts` — relative time bucketing (minutes/hours/days).
- `lib/useDebounce.ts` — debounced state with fake-timer assertions, including rapid-change collapse.
- `components/StatusBadge.tsx` — value rendering, snake_case normalisation, default tone.
- `components/LiveEventToast.tsx` — toast appearance for high-severity events, incident callout, manual dismiss.
- `components/ActivitySparkline.tsx` — peak-hour callout, empty-window survival.

Backend coverage includes:

- Auth: login happy path, wrong password, unknown email, all three roles, `/me` with valid/missing/expired token
- Assets: list filters, type filter, call sign search, battery sort, detail with event history, 404
- Events: pagination shape, severity/type/time-window filters, sort direction, page_size cap, offset
- Incidents: list filters, detail, 404, full `open→acknowledged→resolved→open` state machine, viewer 403, invalid status 422, summary provider
- Dashboard: overview shape, metric non-negativity, activity 24-bucket structure, `total == sum(counts)`
- Summary cache: first call = live, second call = cached, `?refresh=true` bypass, status-change invalidation
- CSV export: content-type, `Content-Disposition` header, column names, filter passthrough
- Realtime: WebSocket first-frame auth accepts valid JWTs and rejects invalid/malformed frames with `1008`

## Production deployment

The repo ships configs for the recommended target: **Vercel for the frontend, Fly.io for the API + managed Postgres**.

### 1. Deploy the API to Fly.io

```bash
cd apps/api

# One-time: install fly CLI and authenticate
brew install flyctl
fly auth login

# Create the app, attach Postgres, set secrets
fly launch --copy-config --no-deploy --config fly.toml
fly postgres create --name sentinel-db --region ord
fly postgres attach sentinel-db
fly secrets set \
  JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  CORS_ORIGINS="https://<your-vercel-domain>" \
  OPENAI_API_KEY=""  # leave empty to use the deterministic fallback

# Ship it. The Dockerfile entrypoint runs `alembic upgrade head` before uvicorn.
fly deploy --config fly.toml --dockerfile Dockerfile
```

`fly.toml` declares the health check (`GET /api/health`), HTTPS-only routing, and a soft concurrency cap of 200 connections — enough headroom for the WebSocket clients connected by every dashboard tab.

### 2. Deploy the frontend to Vercel

```bash
# One-time: install Vercel CLI and authenticate
npm i -g vercel
vercel login

# Link the repo (run from repo root — vercel.json builds apps/web)
vercel link

# Set the build-time env var pointing at the Fly API
vercel env add VITE_API_BASE_URL production   # paste: https://sentinel-ops-api.fly.dev

# Ship it
vercel deploy --prod
```

`vercel.json` at repo root tells Vercel to install + build inside `apps/web` and serve `apps/web/dist`. The SPA rewrite routes every non-asset path to `index.html` so the React Router deep links work.

The live URLs from this deploy already power the *Live demo* table at the top of this README.

### Production environment variables

| Variable | Side | Where to set |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | API | `fly secrets set` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | API | set automatically by `fly postgres attach` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | API | `fly secrets set` — must contain the Vercel domain |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API | `fly secrets set` (optional; empty → deterministic fallback) |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Frontend | `vercel env add` — must be the Fly app URL over HTTPS |

`VITE_WS_BASE_URL` is derived from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` automatically (`https://` → `wss://`); override only if the API and WebSocket origins ever diverge.

---

## Migrations

Two paths coexist on purpose:

- **Production (Fly.io)** — the Docker entrypoint runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting uvicorn. Alembic is the source of truth for schema changes against Postgres.
- **Local development and tests** — `Base.metadata.create_all()` runs on startup so a fresh SQLite file is ready instantly without an extra command. Tests use an isolated SQLite DB created the same way.

The first migration captures the operational indexes used by asset, event, incident, and summary-cache queries. To apply migrations manually against any environment:

```bash
cd apps/api
alembic upgrade head
```

---

## Design decisions

**Why the ABC provider interface for AI?**
`IncidentSummaryProvider` is an abstract base class with a single `generate(context)` method. `OpenAIIncidentSummaryProvider` calls Chat Completions with a structured JSON response schema; `FallbackIncidentSummaryProvider` returns a deterministic template without any network call. The DB cache layer wraps both through the same interface. This means: zero API calls during tests, safe demo without an OpenAI key, and adding a new provider (Anthropic, Azure OpenAI) is a one-class change.

**Why DB-level caching instead of Redis?**
For a single-region operational demo, writing the summary into the same SQLite/Postgres instance as the incident data keeps the dependency count at zero and avoids cross-service consistency edge cases. The cache row is invalidated explicitly on status change — not solely via TTL — because the incident status appears in the prompt. Serving a stale "open" summary after an acknowledgement would mislead operators.

**WebSocket first-frame auth handshake**
The bearer token is sent as the first WebSocket text frame (`{"type":"auth","token":"<JWT>"}`) rather than as a URL query parameter. This keeps the credential out of web server access logs and browser history, which record the full URL including the query string. The server closes with code `1008` (Policy Violation) if the frame is missing, malformed, or carries an invalid token, which the client interprets as a permanent failure (stops reconnecting). The 5-second handshake timeout prevents resource leaks from half-open connections.

**Why WebSockets over polling?**
The event simulator fires every 8 seconds. Polling at sub-10 s intervals from an operations console with dozens of concurrent clients produces a thundering herd on every tick. A single persistent WebSocket per client — with React Query invalidation on push — keeps the UI fresh without the overhead.

**Why Leaflet instead of a dedicated mapping SDK?**
CartoDB Dark Matter tiles are free and require no API key, which keeps the demo self-contained. Custom `divIcon` markers colored by asset status and ephemeral `Circle` pulse rings (6 s auto-dismiss) demonstrate the map is live-data-wired, not decorative. Adding a satellite layer or a heatmap overlay would be a straightforward extension.

**Incident state machine enforcement**
The allowed transitions are:

```
open → acknowledged
acknowledged → resolved | open
resolved → open
```

Enforced on the backend — invalid transitions return `422 Unprocessable Entity` with a descriptive message. The frontend mirrors this logic to hide inapplicable action buttons, but the backend is the authority. Viewers receive `403 Forbidden` on any status mutation regardless of the proposed transition.
